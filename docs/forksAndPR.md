# Forking a Repository

## How to Fork a Repository

1. First, navigate to the repository on GitHub that you want to fork.

2. Once you are on the repository's page, click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

3. Next, navigate to your forked repository on GitHub. You can find this by going to your GitHub profile and clicking on the repository name.

4. Clone the repository to your local machine by copying the URL from the "Code" dropdown button on GitHub and running the command "git clone [paste URL here]" in your terminal or command prompt.

5. Create a new branch for your changes using the command "git checkout -b [branch name]".

You have now successfully created a forked repository and cloned it to your local machine. You can now make changes to the repository and push them to your forked repository on GitHub. This will allow you to make changes to the repository without affecting the main branch.

## How to Submit a Pull Request

1. Make the changes that you want to contribute to the original repository. Once you have made and tested your changes, stage and commit them using the "git add" and "git commit" commands.

2. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the command "git push origin [branch name]".

3. Once your changes are pushed to your forked repository, go to the original repository on GitHub and click on the "Pull Requests" tab.

4. Click on the "New pull request" button and select your forked repository and the branch that contains your changes.

5. Review the changes that you are proposing in the pull request and make sure that everything is correct.

6. If everything looks good, click on the "Create pull request" button. This will notify the owner of the original repository that you have submitted changes and they will be able to review and potentially merge your changes into their repository.

Wait for the owner of the original repository to review your pull request. They may ask for changes or request more information before merging your changes into their repository.
