# Overview of Git and GitHub User Documentation

This document is a guide to using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/). The aim of this guide is to provide a comprehensive introduction to basic Git and GitHub concepts and workflows. We will cover topics such as: creating a repository, pushing and pulling changes, branching, merging, and resolving merge conflicts. By the end of this guide, you should have a basic understanding of how to use Git and GitHub to collaborate with other developers.

Topics included in this guide are:

- Getting Started with Git and GitHub
- Creating a Repository
- Pushing and Pulling Changes
- Forking and Cloning
- Resolving Merge Conflicts

# How the Documentation Was Created

This user guide assignment was completed by the following team members:

- [Joseph Chun](https://github.com/Mrrm2)
- [Kira Yoon](https://github.com/kirayoon)

We created this guide using the knowledge and experience we gained from class, and our own personal experiences using Git and GitHub. We decided on this topic for our guide since we remembered how difficult it was learning how to use Git and GitHub during the first few weeks of school. We also also recognize the importance of using a version control system, and the applicability of this knowledge to future careers. Therefore we wanted to create a guide that would help other students, and walk them through each process step-by-step.

## MkDocs Material

This documentation was created using [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Using MkDocs material allowed us to bootstrap a documentation site quickly and easily. It also provides a clean and modern look to the documentation site. The flexibility of MkDocs Material also allowed us to customize the site to our liking.

## Markdown

We used [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to write this guide. We found that writing in Markdown was simple and easy to learn. It also allowed us to write this guide quickly and efficiently. The popularity of Markdown also allowed us to find many resources online to help us write this guide.

## Style Guide

We used the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to help us write this guide in Markdown. We also took inspiration from the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide] (https://developers.google.com/style) when writing this guide. However, we did not follow the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide exactly. We made changes where we saw fit, and we also added our own style guide rules. This allowed us to personalize the creation of this guide.

## Collaborating

Since MkDocs Material allowed us to modularly create this guide, we found it easy to split up the work between the two of us. This allowed us to work on the guide at our own pace, and also allowed us to collaborate on the guide at the same time. We collaborated using GitHub to keep track of our changes, and to keep our codebase organized.
